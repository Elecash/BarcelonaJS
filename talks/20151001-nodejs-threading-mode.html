<h1 id="nodejs-threading-mode">NodeJS threading mode</h1>
<p>This talk will explore the architecture of the threading model of NodeJS. In this model, the programmer works in a single threaded environment but leverages the asynchronous operations to system threads managed by the framework. This makes NodeJS very suitable for small services non CPU-bounded that communicate with external services or perform asynchronous operations, like querying a caching backend (memcached) or adding elements to a queue system.</p>
