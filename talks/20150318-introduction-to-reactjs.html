<p>Building UI&#39;s is hard, but JavaScript is not to blame. Facebook&#39;s open source UI library React.js introduces a sane solution to building UI&#39;s, based on uni-directional flow and components with clear interfaces. Although object oriented in appeareance, React builds itself on a functional programming basis, making programs written by this library easy to develop and reason about. In this talk, we will go over the founding principles of this exciting library which has been steadily gaining popularity since it was first introduced in May 2013. We will also briefly talk about accompanying technologies such as Flux, immutablejs and react-router.</p>
