<h1 id="an-introduction-to-lovefield-cross-browser-rdb">An introduction to Lovefield, cross-browser RDB</h1>
<p>In this talk I will give an introduction to <a href="https://google.github.io/lovefield/">Lovefield</a>, a cross-browser SQL-Like, relational query engine for web, written purely in Javascript.
I will make an introduction why has been created, what problems it does help to solve, its quirks and the reasons of them.
I will also briefly introduce <a href="https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/">sql.js</a> to end up with a live simple demo comparing both.</p>
